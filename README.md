# Demo-SQL-DBMS-Hosp
Code for a demo SQL DBMS hospital using MySQL

Ref: UCF CGS 2545  Fall 2020

This is coding specific to project requirements for a demo hospital DBMS. 

It is assumed the reader already knows how to create an SQL DBMS database from scratch.
The code in the earliest assignments (from assignment 2 up) creates tables with data and primary keys (also altered primary keys).
Duplicated data is removed in later progressive assignments to provide Normalization to the database, 
and relationships with foreign keys are used.  Assignment 9 is the last assignment done for this 
specific project.
